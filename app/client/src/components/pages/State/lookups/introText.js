Some waterbodies are impaired by toxins that accumulate in fish at levels high enough to warrant fish tissue consumption advisories. Most impairments in the State’s waters are the result of nonpoint source pollution. Delaware is seeing reductions in nutrients and toxins in many watersheds.

Monitoring data are used to not only assess streams, but also to inform permit decisions and to assist in the development of water quality criteria. Recent physical, chemical, or biological survey results are not the only form of data available to inform the assessment process. While recent stream sample data are the ideal, there are other valid information sources, such as GIS analysis of land use, recent aerial photographs, models, self-monitoring reports, compliance inspection results, and overflow reports. Stream assessment decisions are based on multiple sources of evidence and the agency must weigh all available information to arrive at a conclusion. TDEC’s watershed approach serves as an organizational framework for systematic assessment of the state’s water quality. By viewing the entire drainage area or watershed as a whole, the department is better able to schedule water quality monitoring, assessment, permitting activities, and stream restoration efforts. This unified approach affords a more in-depth study of each watershed and encourages coordination of public and governmental organizations. The watersheds are assessed on a five-year cycle that coincides with permit issuance. The purpose of the division’s water quality monitoring program is to provide a measure of Tennessee's progress towards meeting the goals established in the federal Clean Water Act and the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act.",

      'The Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) has divided the state into nine major water management basins and employs a rotating basin strategy that targets a different basin each year. IDEM’s Clean Water Act (CWA) water quality assessments also follow this rotating basin approach, which ensures that all basins in the state are assessed at least once every nine years. Most of the data used to make CWA assessments comes from IDEM’s Probabilistic Monitoring Program, for which the sites are randomly chosen to allow for two types of assessments – stream-specific assessments and comprehensive, basin-wide assessments. For stream-specific assessments, monitoring results are compared to applicable water quality criteria to determine whether or not the stream(s) represented by the data are meeting Indiana’s water quality standards. Comprehensive assessments are statistical calculations that allow IDEM to predict with reasonable certainty the percentage of Indiana’s rivers and streams within a given basin that are either impaired or supporting their designated uses. Comprehensive use support assessments are based solely on the reach-specific assessment results from the data collected by the Probabilistic Monitoring Program because they are collected using a probability-based (randomized) sampling design, which is necessary to make statistically valid calculations. IDEM’s comprehensive use support assessments and its reach-specific assessments of designated use support provide water quality information in two very different ways, and IDEM uses both types of assessments to meet different CWA requirements. The agency’s comprehensive assessments rely on probabilistic data to provide statistically valid statements about the overall water quality throughout Indiana on a basin level, which allows IDEM to meet the CWA requirement to assess all the waters of the state. In contrast to stream-specific assessments, comprehensive assessments are statistically derived and cannot be applied to specific streams or stream reaches. ',

      'Kansas Department of Health and Environment assesses and monitors ambient water quality to evaluate the attainment of water quality standards through two different approaches: the Probabilistic Monitoring Network and the Targeted Monitoring Network. The Probabilistic Monitoring Network is used to generate estimates for overall stream condition in Kansas. Each year, this program samples a new set of about 40 randomly selected stream and river reaches throughout the state, collecting data on water chemistry, macroinvertebrate assemblage, and fish tissue contaminants. These assessments are extrapolated to the state as a whole and represent a statistically unbiased snapshot of stream condition in a given time period. The targeted network includes several monitoring programs that focus on carefully selected, targeted sites on streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These sites are in fixed locations that are sampled every year or every few years. Assessments for streams are conducted on a watershed basis, where stream station assessments are associated with the stream reaches in the contributing watershed. The targeted stream chemistry monitoring network consists of 329 sampling stations and generates physical, chemical, radiological, and microbiological data useful in the characterization of pollutant loadings from more than 97 percent of the state’s contributing drainage area. Information derived from this network is applied in the development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for water quality-limited streams and in the formulation of water quality-based permit limits for facilities discharging treated effluent to the waters of the state. Another targeted program, the stream biological monitoring program, evaluates the pollution-tolerance of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at approximately 180 locations in Kansas. Information from this program enhances the department’s ability to detect water pollution problems, identify contaminants of concern, and develop defensible TMDLs and wastewater treatment plant permits. Kansas also routinely surveys 188 publicly owned (or publicly accessible) lakes and wetlands. Physicochemical and biological data generated by this program are applied in the development of TMDLs and water quality-based permit limits, the resolution of toxic algal blooms and algal-related taste and odor problems, the characterization of lake trophic condition, and the tracking and prediction of long-term trends in surface water quality.',

The majority of rivers originate in the pristine high alpine environment of the Rocky Mountains and flow downstream through the high desert or high plains regions before leaving the state. Nearly half of the state is flat in contrast to Colorado’s rugged Rocky Mountains. Numerous dams and reclamation projects on the rivers provide water for irrigation and municipal and industrial use, as well as supply hydroelectric power. Colorado has divided the state into seven major river basins and employs a rotating basin strategy that targets a different basin each year. Colorado's water quality assessments also follow this rotating basin approach, which ensures that all basins in the state are assessed at least once every five years. The major river basins of Colorado are the: Arkansas, Rio Grande, San Juan, Colorado, Green, South Platte, and Republican. The largest of these basins on a national level is the Colorado River Basin, which has its headwaters in Rocky Mountain National Park, flows from Colorado through Utah and the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and ultimately completes its journey at the Gulf of California. Colorado assesses it surface waters to be protective of their uses. Classified uses are assigned to waterbodies based upon the actual uses occurring in the waterbody. Water quality standards are in place to ensure that the waterbody is attaining the classified uses assigned. These uses have been adopted as follows: aquatic life, water supply, recreation, wetlands and agriculture.",

Our core work consists of water quality permitting, water quality improvement projects, and clean water financial assistance. We maintain the state's database of polluted waters (Section 303d list). which is part of our Water Quality Assessment process.We use public involvement processes to inform our decision-making. We rely heavily on feedback we receive from businesses, environmental groups, local governments, tribes, and citizens. The Water Quality program's goals are to prevent and reduce water pollution, to clean up polluted waters, and engage citizens in the work to protect and restore water quality in Washington.",

    intro:
      'Alaska has more water in the form of lakes, streams, rivers, coastline and wetlands than any other state in the union. Nearly half of the total surface waters of the United States are located within Alaska. Currently, less than 10% of Alaska’s waters have been assessed by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). However, because of the state’s geographic size, sparse population, and remote character, the vast majority of its water resources are likely in near-pristine condition. In Alaska, surface water sources supply fresh water for three-fourths of the water needed for industry, agriculture, mining, fish processing and public water use. Surface water is also the source for about half of the domestic water supply. Alaska surface waters include tens of thousands of salmon streams, which are an important resource for Alaskans and the world. ADEC is responsible for protecting human health and the environment in this vast and water-rich state. More information on Alaska’s water quality can be found at http://dec.alaska.gov/water.aspx',
