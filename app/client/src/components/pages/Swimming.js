          Learn whether your local waters have been deemed safe for swimming and
          other recreational activities. Find out about what impairments exist
          in your local waterbodies. Water quality can change on very short
          notice. When deciding if it is safe to swim in a waterbody, refer to
          any local or state advisories. If available, refer to local or state
          real-time water quality reports.
