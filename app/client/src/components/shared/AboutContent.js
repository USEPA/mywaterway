              <h3>About impairment reporting</h3>
              <p>
                The Clean Water Act requires States, Territories and authorized
                tribes (states for brevity) to monitor water impairments and
                report to EPA every two years on the waters they have evaluated.
                This process is called{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="assessment">assessment</GlossaryTerm>. Part
                of this process is deciding which waters do not meet{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="water quality standards">
                  water quality standards
                </GlossaryTerm>
                . These waters are called{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="impaired">impaired</GlossaryTerm> (impaired
                enough to require action) and are placed on a State list for
                future actions to reduce pollution. The local information
                displayed in <em>How’s My Waterway </em>
                includes whether and when a waterway was assessed, which
                impairments may exist, and what has been done to improve
                conditions.
              </p>

              <h3>About water quality information</h3>
              <p>
                EPA's water databases are the largest single, national source of
                information about reported water quality problems and efforts to
                fix them. Other information not directly accessible in this tool
                exists in federal, State, local, and private sources. Some of
                these sources appear on the <a href="/data">data page</a>. Many
                waters in the US have not been assessed and sometimes there is
                little or no information reported about their condition. A
                waterway that has not been assessed may or may not be{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="impaired">impaired</GlossaryTerm>, and an
                impaired waterway may have more impairments than those that were
                measured and reported.
              </p>

              <h3>About impairment categories</h3>
              <p>
                A single waterway can have one or more types of impairments.
                When States report impaired waters, they put them in different
                categories. EPA uses major categories of water impairments in
                its national summary. There are more detailed subcategories
                within each of these. For example, the category "Metals" may
                include lead, cadmium, zinc, or copper as water pollutants. A
                filtering tool for these impairments can be found on the{' '}
                <a href="/data">data page</a> (Impairment Category Filtering
                Tool: How ATTAINS data are grouped in How’s My Waterway); which
                will allow you to find out the subcategories for the impairment.{' '}
                <em>How’s My Waterway </em> provides simple descriptions of each
                major category, where the impairment comes from, its effect on
                the environment and on beneficial waterway uses, what citizens
                can do to help, and where to find more information. This
                information can be found in the glossary.
              </p>

              <h3>About what’s being done</h3>
              <p>
                Identifying and reporting water impairments leads to action for
                improvement. Two major types of action taken under the Clean
                Water Act are{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="tmdl">
                  Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) 
                </GlossaryTerm>{' '}
                restoration plans and{' '}
                <GlossaryTerm term="nonpoint source pollution">
                  nonpoint source pollution
                </GlossaryTerm>{' '}
                projects. Tens of thousands of impaired waters now have a TMDL
                restoration plan, which is a 'reduced pollution diet' designed
                to help waters become healthy again. The TMDL serves as a basic
                game plan for a variety of different restoration activities,
                including watershed restoration plans. EPA provides funds to
                States to help control nonpoint source pollution , which
                generally originate from landscape runoff rather than a single
                discharge pipe. <em>How’s My Waterway</em> identifies whether an
                impaired waterway has a TMDL restoration plan or a nonpoint
                source pollution project.

              <h3>What is “How’s My Waterway?”</h3>
              <p>
                <em>How’s My Waterway</em> is an EPA tool that helps users find
                information on the condition of their waters quickly using a
                smart phone, tablet, or desktop computer. This information is
                displayed on 3 scales; community, state, and national. This tool
                for technical and non-technical users offers easy access, a
                local-area focus, plain-English terms and descriptions (see
                glossary), and quickly accessible results within seconds based
                on the same comprehensive data found in several EPA databases
                (see <a href="/data">data page</a>).

              </p>

              <h3>Why was How’s My Waterway developed?</h3>
              <p>
                <em>How’s My Waterway</em> was developed to help users find
                basic information about the condition of their waterways and
                provides easy access to EPA’s comprehensive public water quality
                information. The main source of data comes from EPA’s national
                information system on water quality assessments -- ATTAINS -- a
                technical database designed for specialized scientific and
                technical uses. For many years, EPA has compiled valuable
                nationwide information on the condition of healthy and impaired
                waterways, gathered through Clean Water Act assessment and
                reporting by States and territories. To many Americans, however,
                one local lake or stream is a more important part of their lives
                than the thousands of waters described in our national
                statistics. Users can use their location or provide an address
                or area of interest to receive plain-English information about
                waters in their local watershed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without being experts in water quality or databases, people have
                needed an easier way to learn about their local waters, their
                problems and why they matter, and what’s being done to improve
                conditions. Faced with a baffling array of scientific
                information and complex technical databases, an average citizen
                might say, “All I really want to know is, how’s{' '}
                <strong>MY</strong> waterway? And please tell me in words I
                understand.”
              </p>

              <p>
                <em>How’s My Waterway</em> is fully functional when accessed
                through browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet
                Explorer and Safari using your desktop computer, tablet, or
                smart phone. It is platform-independent.
              </p>

              <h3>Is How’s My Waterway a smart phone app?</h3>
              <p>
                Actually it is a mobile-friendly tool -- a smart phone or tablet
                user can consult <em>How’s My Waterway</em> outdoors at the
                water’s edge, and retrieve information for that specific
                waterway with the “Use My Location” option, or search anywhere
                in the U.S. with the "Choose a Location" option. A smart phone
                user can save the <em>How’s My Waterway</em> link on their home
                screen and use it just like any other phone app. However, there
                is no app available through common app stores.
