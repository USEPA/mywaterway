    "content": "<p>Nationally, more than 70% of our estuaries have healthy biological communities while fewer than half of our rivers and streams, lakes, wetlands and Great Lakes coasts do. Biological condition tells us how healthy a waterbody is. A healthy waterbody supports biological communities such as fish, insects, crayfish, and vegetation. Excess nutrients, sediments, other pollution and alterations to habitat can negatively impact these communities.</p>"

    "content": "<p><a href='https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Excess Nutrients in Waterways</a> <span>(opens new browser tab)</span> is one of America’s most widespread water quality issues. While nutrients are important, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing. In the U.S., 58% of rivers and streams, 40% of lakes and 21% of coastal waters have high levels of nutrients. Excess nutrients can lead to excessive algae growth, which can use up oxygen that aquatic organisms need to survive. Too much algae growth can cause fish to die. <a href='https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/what-epa-doing-reduce-nutrient-pollution' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Learn more about what EPA is doing to reduce excess nutrients in waterways</a> <small>(opens new browser tab)</small>.</p>",
