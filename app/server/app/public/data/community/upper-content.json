  "extremeWeather": {
    "body": "<p>Explore potentially vulnerable waters, infrastructure, and communities alongside information on current, historical, and potential future <strong>extreme weather events</strong> (and associated events like wildfires) and <strong>climate</strong> for the selected watershed and county. Extreme events such as drought and flooding, caused by natural phenomena or human activity, typically happen infrequently, vary from normal conditions in severity or duration, and can have severe impacts on natural and human systems. Changes in climate over many years may impact the frequency, intensity, duration, and timing of extreme events in certain areas. Explore the map and information below to learn more.</p><div data-show-less-more><p>Extreme weather events impact both the quality and volume of clean, safe water available for different uses such as drinking, eating fish, recreation, and aquatic life. For example, intense storms can increase pollution loads and accelerate erosion and sedimentation, and drought dwindles water supplies, both of which result in concentrated pollutant loads. Intense rainstorms, flooding, drought, wildfire, and extreme temperatures also stress and damage the operation of already aging infrastructure and can disrupt or displace communities. Here are examples of how extreme weather events and associated environmental impacts can affect potentially vulnerable waters, infrastructure, and communities:</p> <div class=\"paragraph-list\"><p><strong>Flooding</strong>: Heavy rainfall and intense storms can cause flooding and damage critical infrastructure (e.g., sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities) and disrupt or displace communities. During a flood, underground storage tank (UST) systems may become displaced or damaged and release their contents into the environment, causing soil, surface water, and groundwater contamination.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/manage-flood-risk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Manage Flood Risk</a></li></ul></div> <div class=\"paragraph-list\"><p><strong>Drought</strong>: Drought conditions are projected to intensify across much of the country. During a drought, water utilities can face a loss of water supply and increased demand from customers. Drought can reduce short term water sources, such as reservoir or lake levels, or affect longer-term storage, such as mountain snowpack. Drought can also increase drinking water treatment costs by concentrating contaminates in source waters and thereby diminishing source water quality (see: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/arc-x/climate-adaptation-and-source-water-impacts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Climate Adaptation and Source Water Impacts</a>).</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/natural-disasters/drought\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drought</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/waterutilityresponse/drought-response-and-recovery-water-utilities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drought Response and Recovery for Water Utilities</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/crwu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating Resilient Water Utilities (CRWU)</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-change-water-sector/drought-and-water-scarcity-initiatives\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drought and Water Scarcity Initiatives</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/water-research/drought-resilience-and-water-conservation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Drought Resilience and Water Conservation</a></li></ul></div> <p><strong>Wildfire</strong>: Wildfire frequency, extent, and intensity are projected to increase with higher temperatures and drought conditions in parts of the United States. During active burning, ash and contaminants associated with ash settle on streams, lakes, and water reservoirs. Vegetation that holds soil in place and retains water is burned away. In the aftermath of a large wildfire, rainstorms flush vast quantities of ash, sediment, nutrients and contaminants into streams, rivers, and downstream reservoirs. The absence of vegetation in the watershed can create conditions conducive to erosion and even flooding, and naturally occurring and anthropogenic substances can impact drinking water quality, discolor recreational waters, and may potentially contribute to harmful algal blooms (see: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/wildfires-how-do-they-affect-our-water-supplies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wildfires: How Do They Affect Our Water Supplies?</a>).</p> <p><strong>Extreme heat</strong>: In many areas, increased water temperatures (linked to increasing air temperature) will cause eutrophication and excess algal growth, which may reduce drinking water quality (see: <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/arc-x/climate-impacts-water-quality\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Climate Impacts on Water Quality</a>).</p> <p><strong>Extreme cold</strong>: Water and wastewater utilities are vulnerable to extreme cold and winter storms. Freezing temperatures and winter storms can damage pipes, restrict water intakes, and disrupt water services to communities (see: <a href=\"https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/extreme_cold_and_winter_storms.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Incident Action Checklist – Extreme Cold and Winter Storms (PDF)</a>).</p></div>",
