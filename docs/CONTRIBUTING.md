## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [change requests](#change_requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests or questions. Use the shared email account [mywaterway@epa.gov](mailto:mywaterway@epa.gov) instead.

* Please **do not** derail issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others. Start a new issue for a new change instead of using the same thread for multiple changes.

## Change Requests

Good change requests (changes, enhancements, bugs) are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for change requests:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the change has already been requested.

2. **Check if the change request or issue has been fixed** &mdash; try latest `develop` branch.

A good change request (change, enhancement, or bug) shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
